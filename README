luCAS - a work-in-progress toy CAS written in lua

Whats works:
- Basic operations (+, -, *, /, ^, !, =, !=, <, <=, >, >=, ...)
- Fractions (n:d)
- Symbolic math

  Automatic simplification and functions for expression manipulation
    factor_out(a b+c a)
    expand((3+x)(x+2))
    map($1^2, {1,2,3})

- Basic unit support (no support for finding matching compound units)

  Some units are defined (see units.lua)
    1_m + 10_cm

- Polynom division

  Polynom devision with result and remainder as vector
    poly.div(x^2+1,x-1,1)

- Pattern matching
    
  Definition of function 'sign' with 3 different cases
    sign(x) :: x < 0 := -1
    sign(x) :: x > 0 := 1
    sign(0) := 0
    

What does not:
- Everything else :-)
- Correct infinity handling
